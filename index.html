      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <hr>
      <article class="blog-post">
        <p>The epidemic has significantly impacted various aspects of society, including housing and eviction policies. It is crucial to understand these changes to inform and improve decision-making for tenants, landlords, and policymakers. This visualization project will explore how the epidemic has affected eviction cases by analyzing docket information collected before and after the epidemic and presenting findings in a clear and accessible manner for a broad audience. Eviction is the legal process by which a landlord removes a tenant from their rental property, usually due to a breach of the lease agreement, non-payment of rent, or the end of the lease term. The eviction process typically involves giving the tenant notice, filing a lawsuit (if necessary), and obtaining a court order for the tenant's removal </p>

        
        <h2>Purpose and Process</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The project aims to investigate how the epidemic has impacted eviction cases by analyzing docket information from both pre and post-epidemic periods. The goal is to create visualizations that unveil potential insights and develop applications that serve as reference materials for tenants, landlords, and policymakers. Specifically, the project seeks to provide insights into the following areas:
Changes in eviction policies: The epidemic might have resulted in temporary or permanent shifts in eviction policies, such as moratoriums, rent relief programs, or alterations in legal eviction requirements. Further research can examine how these policy changes affected judgment distribution and the impact on different jurisdictions.
Impact on tenants and landlords: This project will explore how judgment distribution changes have affected tenants and landlords. For tenants, it may involve assessing improvements in eviction protection or resource access during disputes. It could entail evaluating the impact on property maintenance and eviction cost recovery for landlords.
Legal representation and tenant advocacy: Changes in judgment distribution could indicate an increase in legal representation or tenant advocacy services access for those facing eviction. Further research can determine whether these services have become more widespread and how they influenced case outcomes.
Economic factors: The epidemic's extensive economic repercussions may have affected tenants' rent-paying ability and landlords' eviction pursuit. Investigating the relationship between eviction cases and the broader economic context can yield valuable insights into judgment distribution changes.
Public awareness and education: Changes in judgment distribution might be associated with increased public awareness of tenant rights, eviction processes, and available resources during the epidemic. Examining the role of public information campaigns, media coverage, and educational initiatives in eviction case outcomes can help inform future policy and outreach efforts.

        <h2>Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Our project is based on the real case information collected in 2022 and 2019 from the Williamsburg & James City County Court docket system. The data collection was primarily targeted at eviction cases (categorized as ‘Unlawful Detainer as shown) in Virginia, and WJCC was only a part of the collection spot. Data may include eviction notices, court filings, and judgments for possession.</p>
        <p>A Glance at the Original Data:</p>
        <div class="framed-image">
        <img src="glance1.png" alt="glance1" style="width: 95%; height: 70%;" />
        </div>
        <p>Docket from 201906- 201907</p>
        <div class="framed-image">
        <img src="glance2.png" alt="glance2" style="width: 95%; height: 70%;" />
        </div>
        <p>Docket from 201906- 201907</p>
        <p>The Docket information is cleaned before the visualization: removing N/As, correcting address format, and anonymizing to protect the individual's privacy.</p>
        <p style="padding: 5px;"></p>
        
        <h2>Data Visulization</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>A preliminary data analysis is conducted to identify trends, patterns, and potential relationships between variables. This includes comparing judgment distribution among pre and after-epidemic, principal amount distribution, and policy changes pre- and post-epidemic. Details are included below:</p>
        <p>Case Outcome Interpretation:</p>
        <ul>
                    <li>Plaintiff: Plaintiff(landlord) wins the case;</li>
                    <li>Non-suit: The plaintiff decides not to sue the defendant(tenant) anymore;</li>
                    <li>Case Dismissed: The court decides to terminate a court case without imposing liability on the defendant.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="framed-image">
        <img src="Part2.png" alt="Part 2" style="width: 95%; height: 70%;" />
        </div>
        <h5 style="padding: 5px;">Interpretation of Judgement Distribution:</h5>
        <ul>
                    <li>In 2022, more cases are dismissed, which usually indicates that the tenant was imposed no liability.</li>
                    <li>Meantime, the percentage of non-suit increases, usually indicating that the plaintiff, the landlord, has received the rent, lacks proof to evict a tenant or the change in policy increases the cost for landlords to pursue an eviction.</li>
                    <li>Considering increases in both dismiss rate and non-suit rate, the winning rate for the plaintiff, where the court ruled that the tenant must be evicted compared to the pre-epidemic period, is obviously decreasing. This may be considered a potential positive effect of the RRP carried out during the epidemic. (RRP: Rent Relief Program in Virginia is a state-sponsored initiative designed to provide financial assistance to households facing difficulties in paying rent due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.) </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <div class="framed-image">
          <img src="Part1.png" alt="Part 1" style="width: 95%; height: 70%;" />
        </div>
        <h5 style="padding: 5px;">Interpretation for Principal Amount Distribution:</h5>
        <ul>
                    <li>We clearly conclude that the principal amount (in dollars) is increasing over time.</li>
                    <li>One hypothesis suggests that in 2022, each Unlawful Detainer case experienced multiple continuances as Rent Relief Program (RRP) claims were being processed, accumulating principal amounts owed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="padding: 10px;"></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Continued Visualization: Case Time Length Distribution</p>
        <div class="framed-image">
          <img src="Part3.png" alt="Part 3" style="width: 95%; height: 70%;" />
        </div>
        <h5 style="padding: 5px;">Interpretation for Case Time Length Distribution:</h5>
        <ul>
                    <li>The time length visualization (in days) exhibits a trend parallel to the principal amount distribution, revealing a higher number of cases with substantial principal amounts and extended continuance times. This pattern is evident in the graph, highlighting the potential correlation between larger debts and longer case durations.</li>
                    <li>The similarity in the shape of the time length and principal amount distributions suggests a potential connection. To further validate our hypothesis, it is necessary to examine whether cases with high principal amounts correspond to those with extended continuance durations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="padding: 10px;"></p>
        <h2>Applications and Development:Interactive map of Interaction</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <div class="iframe-container">
          <iframe src="WJCC.html" title="WJCC HTML"></iframe>
        </div>
        <h5 style="padding: 5px;">The Case Map: Geographical Distribution</h5>
        <ul>
                    <li>The geographical locations of each case within the selected time frame are displayed on the map, with Judgement, Principal Amount, and Time Length documented in the tooltip.</li>
                    <li>The integrated map created by incorporating filtered information from the project has the potential to be an invaluable asset for both prospective tenants and landlords (or investors). For tenants, the map offers insight into neighborhoods with lower eviction filing rates and any policy shifts that occurred during the epidemic. This knowledge enables tenants to focus their housing search on areas that offer greater stability. For landlords, the amalgamation of eviction map data and policy changes during the epidemic provides valuable information that can guide their property decision-making process. This may include deciding whether to sell, continue renting, or contemplate switching property management agencies.</li>
        </ul>
